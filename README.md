# Sahayak
## An app to address public grivance issues.
Our country is growing at a very fast pace. Along with it, problems and issues around
us are also increasing. These problems need to be addressed rapidly to keep the
development pace intact. The dynamics of these problems are so massive that we can't
entirely depend on the government alone. We must work together with NGOs, social
workers, and government authorities to optimize the issue addressing process. Our
country is full of good people, and many people want to do social work. But there is no
known established platform where people can raise the issues around, and the NGO or
social worker can volunteer to solve those issues.

So, we came up with the idea to build project Sahayak.
Sahayak will be a platform that will revolutionize how citizens raise problems and
issues around them and how those issues are resolved with the collaborative efforts of
government authorities, NGOs, and social workers.
